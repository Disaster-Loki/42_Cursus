        <p>
          Hi, I’m <strong>Kiyotaka Uchiha</strong> — a passionate developer who thrives on solving complex problems with clean, efficient code. I love low-level programming, system design, and pushing myself beyond comfort zones.
        </p>

        <p>
          My journey into serious programming began at <strong>42 Luanda</strong>, an intense and collaborative school where I honed my skills in C, algorithms, system architecture, and team projects. It was more than a school — it was a mindset shift.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy building tools, contributing to open-source, and constantly improving as an engineer. Outside of coding, I value discipline, curiosity, and creative problem-solving.
        </p>
